```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Greetings! In this work we are going to work with data from fitness trackers. The final goal is to predict with maximum accuracy type of exercise using accelerometers' data.

## Data lookup

Let's load training and testing data:
```{r}
training = read.csv("pml-training.csv")
testing = read.csv("pml-testing.csv")
```

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
